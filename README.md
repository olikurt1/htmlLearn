Elements/tags are like containers for content but there are also void elements which don't hold any content. 

within <html> the lang=en defines the attribute of the language of the content within the HTML file

within <head> is where all the meta information for the file.

within <title> tags the title of the page is put and this corresponds to what is named within a browser tab

<meta> tag stores the meta data for eg charset="UTF-8" is the type of encoding.

<p> tags are required to separate content because if all content is put between one set of these tags then everything will be compressed into one paragraph so the resolution is 

<p>paragraph1<p><p>paragraph2<p>

headings such as <h1> are bolder and bigger naturally and number goes higher the heading size goes smaller

<strong> element buts anything in between it as bold </strong>

nested and indented elements are child elements of a parent element and any element on the same indentation level are sibling elements.
